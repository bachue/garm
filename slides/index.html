					<h3>Exception Monitor for Mozy</h3>
					<p>
						<small>CodeJam project by Bachue from Shanghai Team</small>

					<aside class="notes">
						Hello, everyone. This is Bachue from Shanghai Mozy Team. Today I'd like to introduce you my codejam project, Garm.

					<h1 onclick="window.open('/exception mail.png');" style="cursor: pointer;">Exception Mail</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						As you know, nowadays, we use email to report exceptions from our production servers. With exception mails, we can know what happened on production servers before customers report it.
						From this angle, exception email are better than error logs. But is it really perfect?

						<h2>Problems</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Extremely huge number</li>
							<li>Unnecessary</li>
							<li>No priority</li>
							<li>Complicated format</li>
							<li>Hard to track</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							No, actually we have lots of problems with it.
							First, we've received too many mails, too many. My VDI has been exhausted. And I don't dare to use my 16-GB-iPhone to receive them.
							And also, most of them are unnecessary, maybe we've resolved it but haven't release. But we still receive them every day.
							And no priority, we don't know which one is urgent and which one we shouldn't pay lots of time on.
							And very complicated format
							[DEMO]
							This is an real example from my mailbox.
							Especially session and cookie, which is the most important info in my opinion. But they're also the info which are the most difficult to read.
							And even with the mail, we still don't know what user did, to cause the exception. You know, QA guys always tell us to reproduce it, but it's really a challenge. We need logs which record user's action before the exception happened.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h2>We feel tired</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							That's why we feel tired to read them and find bugs from them.

						<h1>Garm</h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							So I designed Garm, which can help us on that.

						<h2>Features</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							So how do I resolved this problem?
							[DOWN]
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Well formatted</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							[DOMO, switch to Garm]
							This is the UI of Garm. See? Very clean design, I used flatten UI which is popular recently.
							All the exceptions list on the left, I also classify them.
							On the right, there's detailed info of the exception.
							[Show all tabs] But not versions and track
							[Compare with cookies and session]
							[Espeically instance variables]
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Priority ordering</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							Garm can help to tell us which exceptions're important.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Percent of Resolved exceptions</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							For example, Percent of Resolved exceptions. In Garm, we can mark exception as resolved or unresolved.
							[DEMO]
							And when we mark them, Garm will get a percentage of resolved exceptions. We can see which project is good and which project we should work on.
							Another feature is Garm won't notify you if you marked it as resolved in this version, until it happened again on a new release.
						</aside>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Charts</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							In Garm, there's several Charts.
							[First tab]
							This chart tell us how many this kind of exceptions happened on each day.
							And this chart tell us how many this kind of exceptions happened on these versions.
